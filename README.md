AutomateQAKart – Industry-Level Automation Framework

Architected and implemented a scalable end-to-end test automation framework for an E-Commerce platform - "AutomateQAKart" using Java, Selenium, and TestNG. 
Designed a robust hybrid framework leveraging "Page Object Model (POM)", data-driven testing using "JSON" file for each test, parallel execution, and retry logic to ensure maximum test stability and coverage of positive and negative scenarios. Also implemented to run in headless mode of the script in "Jenkins".
Engineered a complete CI/CD pipeline by integrating "GitHub" with "Jenkins", via "Webhook triggering" and automated builds using "Apache Maven". 
Additionally implemented "Cucumber" to demonstrate "BDD" capabilities, aligning the framework with real-world enterprise automation practices.
